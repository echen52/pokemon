# Pokemon Programs 

Here are the Pokemon programs I have developed for Generations III-VI. Please see README in subfolders for more information.

## Generation III

### PalaceAssistant.py



## Generation IV

### HGSSAssistant.py

This program is used for the Battle Frontier in Pokemon Platinum/Heartgold/Soulsilver. Given a trainer name and pokemon seen, this a program can predict the AI Pokemon's instance (1-4) and determine its moves, items, and stats. It also displays the probabilities of the next Pokemon seen. This additional information is extremely valuable for obtaining winstreaks in the Battle Frontier. Requires the .csv files to be saved in the same folder as the Python program. 

### CastleAssistant.py

## Generation V

### SubwayAssistant.py

This program works exactly like HGSSAssistant, but used for the Battle Subway in Pokemon Black/White/Black2/White2.

### SubwayDoublesAssistant.py

This program will extends SubwayAssistant to Double Battles, displaying up to 4 Pokemon sets. 

## Generation VI

### MaisonAssistant.py 

This program works exactly like HGSSAssistant, but used for the Battle Maison in Pokemon X/Y/Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire.
