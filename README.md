# Pokemon Programs 

Here are the Pokemon programs I have developed for Generations III-VI. Please see README in subfolders for more information.

## Generation III

### PalaceAssistant.py

This program is used for the [Battle Palace](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Battle_Palace) in Pokemon Emerald. Given a trainer name and pokemon seen, this a program can predict the AI Pokemon's instance (1-4) and determine its moves, items, and stats. It also displays the probabilities of the next Pokemon seen. Move selection is not allowed in the Battle Palace; rather, moves are chosen by the AI or randomly depending on the Pokemon's nature. This program will categorize the moves into 3 categories: Attack, Defense, or Support. Then, it display the probabilities of the opponent Pokemon's probability of a move in each, as well as the probability of "no move" and random behavior. 

## Generation IV

### HGSSAssistant.py

This program is used for the [Battle Tower](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Battle_Tower_(Sinnoh)) in Pokemon Platinum/Heartgold/Soulsilver. Given a trainer name and pokemon seen, this a program can predict the AI Pokemon's instance (1-4) and determine its moves, items, and stats. It also displays the probabilities of the next Pokemon seen. This additional information is extremely valuable for obtaining winstreaks in the Battle Tower. Requires the .csv files to be saved in the same folder as the Python program. 

### CastleAssistant.py

This program is used for the [Battle Castle](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Battle_Castle) in Pokemon Platinum/Heartgold/Soulsilver. Using the "Summary" option before each battle will display the Nature/Ability/Item of 3 unknown Pokemon species, along with their stat values for Attack/Defense/Special Attack/Special Defense/Speed. Using this program and inputting Nature/Ability/Item will display the full information of the Pokemon species as well as their moves, which allows the user to prepare their team for the challenge.

## Generation V

### SubwayAssistant.py

This program works exactly like HGSSAssistant, but used for the [Battle Subway](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Battle_Subway) in Pokemon Black/White/Black2/White2.

### SubwayDoublesAssistant.py

This program extends SubwayAssistant to Double Battles, displaying up to 4 Pokemon sets. 

## Generation VI

### MaisonAssistant.py 

This program works exactly like HGSSAssistant, but used for the [Battle Maison](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Battle_Maison) in Pokemon X/Y/Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire.
